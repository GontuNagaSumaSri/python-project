        "Statement of the Problem:

Wastewater use in crop production is not without some risks. The main risk associated with wastewater irrigation is infection with intestinal helminthes. Also, depending on the source of the wastewater it might contain chemical pollutants and heavy metals that can accumulate in the soil and crops thereby posing a threat to human health. However, a major drive towards wastewater use is the fact that it contains high levels of nutrients, reducing the need for and cost of fertilizers. Consequently, many farmers using wastewater are better able to support themselves and their families and often create extra employment".

            "Objectives of the Study:

1.   To evaluate the use of domestic waste water for irrigation of vegetable crops.

2.   To evaluate the health implications of domestic waste water for irrigation of vegetable crops.

Significance of the Study:

This study will be of immense benefit to other researchers who intend to know more on this study and can also be used by non-researchers to build more on their research work. This study contributes to knowledge and could serve as a guide for other study.

Scope of the Study

This study is on the use of domestic waste water for irrigation of vegetable crops was conducted in Accra and Kumasi in Ghana.

Limitations of the study:

Financial constraint: Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).

Time constraint: The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work."
