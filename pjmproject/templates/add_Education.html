        1.2 Statement of the Problem

There are many factors that have contributed to low performance in mathematics and the use of Multi-media materials is one of the key factors among others. The use of Multi-media materials in number work is minimal that is why achievement in number work is very poor. Multi-media materials are very important in teaching number work since they help learners to master the concept so easily and help teachers to deliver the content with a lot of ease. Children learn by doing hence need materials that they can manipulate.

1.3 Purpose of the Study

The purpose of the study was to establish whether the use of Multi-media materials influenced the achievement of pre-school children in learning of number work.

1.4 Research Objectives

The study was guided by the following objectives:

·       To explain the influence of Audio –Visual materials on pre-school children’s learning achievement in number work in Little Angel Montessori School.

            " 1.6 Significance of the Study

It was hoped that the study of the effects of Multi-media materials on pre-school children’s achievement in learning number work generated information to education stakeholders and curriculum developers with basic information to stimulate further debate on the best approaches to stimulate the learning of mathematics in pre-schools and source of reference when researching on Multi-media materials.

1.7 Limitation of the Study

The results of the study were only generalized to the population involved in this study. The area of study was limited to Little Angel Montessori School.

The research instruments used did not bring out all aspects related to the topic under investigation.

1.8 Delimitations of the Study

The study was carried out among pre-school teachers and pre-school children of Little Angel Montessori School

1.9 Basic Assumptions

The study assumed that all Early Childhood centres had adequate and relevant resources for teaching number work and that the government and parents provided Multi-media materials for learning number work.
